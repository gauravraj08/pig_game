# Pig Game
## Follow this rules to play

Objective: Be the first player to reach a score of 100.

Game Play:

 -> On each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they like, adding up the points on each roll.
 -> They can choose to "Hold" at any time, which means they add their current total to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

Risk of Rolling 1:

 -> If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points collected during that turn and their turn ends immediately.

Winning: The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
